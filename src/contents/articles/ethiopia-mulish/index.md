An unfortunately underwhelming Ethiopian coffee, the Mulish allows its less desirable notes dominate the softer floral and citrus notes.

### Brewing
**Aroma:** Lime, cherry   
**Thoughts:** Starts off with a very quick bloom. After some trial and error I found that this coffee does better with a courser grind and will over expose very quickly.   
### Tasting
**Aroma:** Lime, jasmine honeysuckle, maple syrup,      
**Notes I felt:** Maple syrup, lime   
**Description:** The Panther Coffee Ethiopia Mulish starts off lime and a grassy note that is almost moldy in flavor. These give way to jasmine and subtle berry notes. These a leave a full finish of maple syrup and ash. Overall, I would describe it as a very sturdy coffee that has a tendency to let it's less desirable notes dominate the softer floral and citrus notes.

**Expected:** 7/10
