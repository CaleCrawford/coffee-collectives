**Description:** The Mutu Batak opens up strong with vibrant notes of cedar and magnolia. These almost seamlessly flow into a middle of hops and wine. The body even through a chemex is somewhere between creamy and full. The finish leaves balanced and deep notes of date and soil. The only thing negative that I can say is that this coffee tend to start to show bitterness as it cools. This coffee somehow manages to bring with it all of the things I love about Sumatran coffees while removing all of the ash and bitterness that is so characteristic of coffees from this region. Without a doubt the best Sumatran coffee I have had. It is certainly a potential candidate for my favorite coffee of all time. 
### Conclusion 
**Expected:** 7.5/10   
**Rating:** 9.5/10
