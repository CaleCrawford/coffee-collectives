**Description:** A very light coffee, the Kenya Kirinyaga bring out feelings of spring and new life with a light and tea-like body. It has a nice balanced start that bring about notes of mango and tangerine. These flavors flow smoothly into a caramel and sugar cane center. Unfortunately, these are then overcome by a wild and unbalance aftertaste of bitter lime and lingering green apple. Even considering the unbalanced aftertaste, the Kirinyaga is a very satisfying cup that fits perfectly on a green spring day.
### Conclusion 
**Expected:** 9/10   
**Rating:** 8/10
