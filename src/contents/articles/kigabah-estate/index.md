After drinking it a few times, its personality started to grow on me. Immediately, you are met with fairly deep notes of cherry. Even through the chemex, it has a medium smooth body. The finish consists of faint brown sugar and nectarine. Overall, a delicate coffee that becomes more complex and vibrant as you get to know it.
